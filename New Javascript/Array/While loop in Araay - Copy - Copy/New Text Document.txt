Task: User Information Validation

You have been assigned to create a user information validation system. The system should prompt the user to enter their name, age, and email address. Your task is to implement the following validation checks:

Name Validation:

Check if the name entered by the user is at least 3 characters long.
If the name is valid, convert it to uppercase and display it.
If the name is not valid, display an error message.
Age Validation:

Check if the age entered by the user is a positive integer.
If the age is valid, display a message saying "Welcome [Name], you are [Age] years old."
If the age is not valid, display an error message.
Email Validation:

Check if the email entered by the user contains the '@' symbol.
If the email is valid, display a success message saying "Email validation successful!"
If the email is not valid, display an error message.
Note: You can use if-else statements, loops, string methods, array methods, and other concepts you've learned to implement the validation checks.
